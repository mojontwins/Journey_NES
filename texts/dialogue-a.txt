0|GOOD. WE DON'T LIKE ACCIDENTS. NOT THAT WE HAVE MANY, BUT...
1|I'D RATHER NOT TALK ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY.
0|FAIR ENOUGH. WELL, PROBABLY YOU HAVE GUESSED WHAT YOUR MISSION IS.
1|IT HAS TO DO WITH THOSE STRANGE EGGS, DOESN'T IT?
0|WE HAVE TO REMOVE THE EGGS FROM THE HOST AT ALL COSTS...
0|RIGHT NOW, THE HOST IS DORMANT. THOSE EGGS WILL WREAK HAVOK ONCE THEY HATCH
0|AND WE DON'T WANT THE HOST TO WAKE UP.
1|WHAT IS THE HOST?
0|THAT'S CONFIDENTIAL.
0|NO GO AND RETRIEVE ALL THE EGGS IN THE AREA, THEN GET BACK HERE.
0|CALL ME BY TOUCHING THE RELAY STATION.
1|UNDERSTOOD. NOW, ABOUT MY SUIT...
